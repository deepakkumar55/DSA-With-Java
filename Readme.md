# 1. **Data Structures:** 
These are the ways in which data is organized and stored in a computer's memory. Data structures provide a way to represent and manage data elements and their relationships. Examples of data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables. The choice of an appropriate data structure for a specific problem can greatly impact the efficiency of algorithms that operate on that data.


1. **Arrays and Strings:**
   Definition: Arrays are linear data structures that store elements of the same type sequentially in memory. Strings are sequences of characters.
   Example (Arrays):
   ```java
   int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
   String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};
   ```

2. **Linked Lists:**
   Definition: Linked lists are linear data structures made up of nodes, where each node holds a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
   Example:
   ```java
   class Node {
       int value;
       Node next;
   }
   ```

3. **Stacks and Queues:**
   Definition: Stacks are data structures that follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
   Example (Stack):
   ```java
   import java.util.Stack;
   Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
   stack.push(1);
   stack.push(2);
   int topElement = stack.pop(); // Returns 2
   ```

4. **Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.):**
   Definition: Trees are hierarchical data structures with nodes organized in a branching structure. Binary trees have at most two children per node.
   Example (Binary Search Tree):
   ```java
   class TreeNode {
       int value;
       TreeNode left, right;
   }
   ```

5. **Heaps and Priority Queues:**
   Definition: Heaps are specialized trees used to maintain a priority queue. Priority queues store elements with associated priorities.
   Example (Priority Queue):
   ```java
   import java.util.PriorityQueue;
   PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
   pq.add(5);
   pq.add(2);
   int highestPriority = pq.poll(); // Returns 2
   ```

6. **Hashing:**
   Definition: Hashing maps keys to values using a hash function, enabling fast data retrieval.
   Example (HashMap):
   ```java
   import java.util.HashMap;
   HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
   map.put("apple", 5);
   int value = map.get("apple"); // Returns 5
   ```

7. **Graphs (Graph Representations, Traversal Algorithms, Shortest Path Algorithms, etc.):**
   Definition: Graphs consist of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect these nodes. Graph algorithms solve problems on these structures.
   Example (Graph Representation):
   ```java
   import java.util.ArrayList;
   class Graph {
       int V;
       ArrayList<Integer>[] adjList;
   }
   ```

8. **Hash Tables:**
   Definition: Hash tables use a hash function to map keys to indices, providing efficient data retrieval and storage.
   Example (Hashtable):
   ```java
   import java.util.Hashtable;
   Hashtable<String, Integer> table = new Hashtable<>();
   table.put("dog", 3);
   int value = table.get("dog"); // Returns 3
   ```

9. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   Definition: DSU maintains a collection of disjoint sets, supporting efficient union and find operations.
   Example:
   ```java
   class DisjointSet {
       int[] parent, rank;
       // Methods for union and find
   }
   ```

10. **Trie Data Structure:**
    Definition: A trie is a tree-like data structure used for efficiently storing and searching strings.
    Example:
    ```java
    class TrieNode {
        TrieNode[] children = new TrieNode[26];
        boolean isEndOfWord;
    }
    ```


# 2. **Algorithms:** 
Algorithms are step-by-step instructions or procedures that solve specific computational problems. They provide a clear and systematic way to perform a certain task or computation. Algorithms can vary in terms of their efficiency and complexity. The goal of designing algorithms is to achieve optimal solutions in terms of time and space complexity. Common algorithmic techniques include searching, sorting, recursion, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and divide-and-conquer.


1. **Analysis of Algorithms (Time and Space Complexity):**
   Definition: Analyzing how an algorithm's performance scales with input size, usually measured in time and space complexity.
   Example: Calculating the time complexity of linear search in an array.

2. **Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, etc.):**
   Definition: Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a specific order.
   Example (Quick Sort):
   ```java
   void quickSort(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
       // Partition and recursive calls
   }
   ```

3. **Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search):**
   Definition: Searching algorithms find a specific value or element within a data structure.
   Example (Binary Search):
   ```java
   int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
       // Binary search implementation
   }
   ```

4. **Recursion and Backtracking:**
   Definition: Recursion involves solving a problem by breaking it into smaller subproblems of the same type. Backtracking is a technique for exhaustive problem-solving.
   Example (Factorial using Recursion):
   ```java
   int factorial(int n) {
       if (n == 0) return 1;
       return n * factorial(n - 1);
   }
   ```

5. **Dynamic Programming:**
   Definition: Dynamic programming is a technique to solve complex problems by breaking them into simpler overlapping subproblems.
   Example (Fibonacci using Dynamic Programming):
   ```java
   int fibonacci(int n) {
       int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
       dp[0] = 0; dp[1] = 1;
       for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
           dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
       return dp[n];
   }
   ```

6. **Greedy Algorithms:**
   Definition: Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step to achieve a globally optimal solution.
   Example (Coin Change using Greedy):
   ```java
   int coinChangeGreedy(int[] coins, int amount) {
       // Greedy approach to find minimum coins
   }
   ```

7. **Divide and Conquer:**
   Definition: Divide and conquer algorithms break a problem into smaller subproblems, solve them independently, and combine their solutions to solve the original problem.
   Example (Merge Sort):
   ```java
   void mergeSort(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
       // Divide, conquer, and merge steps
   }
   ```

8. **Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, Kruskal's, Prim's, etc.):**
   Definition: Graph algorithms solve problems related to graphs, such as finding shortest paths, traversing, and spanning trees.
   Example (Breadth-First Search):
   ```java
   void bfs(Graph graph, int start) {
       // BFS implementation
   }
   ```

9. **String Algorithms (Pattern Matching, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.):**
   Definition: String algorithms solve problems involving manipulation and comparison of strings.
   Example (Knuth-Morris-Pratt Pattern Matching):
   ```java
   List<Integer> kmpPatternMatch(String text, String pattern) {
       // KMP algorithm for pattern matching
   }
   ```
